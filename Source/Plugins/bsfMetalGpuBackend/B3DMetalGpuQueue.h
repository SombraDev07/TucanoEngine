		 * Metal implementation of a GPU queue.
		 *
		 * Wraps a @c MTLCommandQueue. One queue is created per GpuQueueType by the device. Metal queues
		 * accept any kind of encoder (graphics, compute, or blit); the type-based split exists purely to
		 * mirror the engine's abstraction and to allow future per-type submission ordering.
		 *
		 * The queue owns a single @c MTLSharedEvent that is signaled on every committed command buffer.
		 * Cross-queue dependencies expressed via @c GpuQueueMask are encoded at submit time by making the
		 * submitted command buffer wait on the target queue's last-committed event value (race-free — see @c GetLastCommittedEventValue), and every submission
		 * increments this queue's own event value once the command buffer finishes its work.
