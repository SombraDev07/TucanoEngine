		 * Metal implementation of @c GpuParameterSetPool.
		 *
		 * Backs transient parameter-set argument buffers with a ring of pooled @c MTLBuffer blocks so
		 * that @c Reset() is a genuine recycle instead of a zero-counter no-op. Every @c Create call
		 * sub-allocates an argument-buffer slice from the current block (bump-allocator). When a
		 * request does not fit, a new block is appended. @c Reset rewinds every block's cursor without
		 * releasing the backing memory, so subsequent frames re-use the same allocations.
		 *
		 * Transient vs persistent semantics:
		 *  - @c Transient pools tolerate the ring-reset model: the engine releases every set back to
		 *    the pool at once via @c Reset, and the engine guarantees no in-flight command buffer still
		 *    references the sets before the reset lands.
		 *  - @c Persistent pools cannot use the ring — individual sets go out of scope independently
		 *    and must keep their argument-buffer slice alive until then. For @c Persistent pools this
		 *    class falls through to a direct @c newBufferWithLength: path, matching the previous
		 *    (pre-B9) behaviour.
		 *  - Requests larger than @c kLargeSliceThreshold bypass the ring entirely even in transient
		 *    pools; tiny frames should not force a multi-MB block to be reserved for them.
