	 * You can use this class as a storage for reading and writing from/to various GPU resources. It is meant to be created
	 * on main thread and used on the render thread. This class is abstract and specific resource types need to implement their
	 * own type of GpuResourceData.
	 *
	 * @note
	 * Normal use of this class involves requesting an instance of GpuResourceData from a Resource, then scheduling a read
	 * or write on that resource using the provided instance. Instance will be locked while it is used by the render thread
	 * and main thread will be allowed to access it when the operation ends. Caller can track AsyncOp%s regarding the
	 * read/write operation to be notified when it is complete.
	 * @note
	 * If you allocate an internal buffer to store the resource data, the ownership of the buffer will always remain with
	 * the initial instance of the class. If that initial instance is deleted, any potential copies will point to garbage
	 * data.
