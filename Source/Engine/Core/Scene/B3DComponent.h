	 * Components represent primary logic elements in the scene. They are attached to scene objects.
	 *
	 * You should implement some or all of Update/FixedUpdate/OnCreated/OnBeginPlay/OnEnabled/OnDisabled/
	 * OnTransformChanged/OnDestroyed methods to implement the relevant component logic. Avoid putting logic in constructors
	 * or destructors.
	 *
	 * Components can be in different states. These states control which of the events listed above trigger:
	 *  - Running - Scene manager is sending out events.
	 *  - Paused - Scene manager is sending out all events except per-frame update().
	 *	- Stopped - Scene manager is not sending out events except for OnCreated/OnDestroyed.
	 *
	 * These states can be changed globally though SceneManager and affect all components. Individual components can
	 * override these states in two ways:
	 *  - Set the ComponentFlag::AlwaysRun to true and the component will always stay in Running state, regardless of
	 *    state set in SceneManager. This flag should be set in constructor and not change during component lifetime.
	 *  - If the component's parent SceneObject is inactive (SceneObject::setActive(false)), or any of his parents are
	 *    inactive, then the component is considered to be in Stopped state, regardless whether the ComponentFlag::AlwaysRun
	 *    flag is set or not.
