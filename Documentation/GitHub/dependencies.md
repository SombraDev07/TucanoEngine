# Compiling dependencies manually

Below you will find a list of dependencies that B3D Framework relies on, as well as links to their source code and/or binaries. If a dependency isn't provided in binary form you will have to manually compile it (this is the case for the large majority or them). Make sure to compile the exact version of the dependency listed below. Newer versions *might* work, but haven't been tested. 

Once you have the dependency development files (headers and binaries) you will need to make sure they placed in the appropriate folders so B3D Framework can find them during the build process. 

The dependencies are searched for in these locations:
- The `/Dependency` folder within framework source. See below for the exact breakdown of how this folder is supposed to look. Usually you want to put all your dependencies here.
- If dependency cannot be found in the `/Dependency` folder, its default install path is searched for instead. For example `usr/local` on Linux/macOS or default install path if the dependency comes with an installer. 

Note that on Windows most dependencies do not have default install paths and should therefore be placed in the `/Dependency` folder. In order to avoid problems with dependency versions this should be the preferred behaviour on Linux/macOS as well. 

`/Dependency` folder breakdown:
- Static & shared libraries (.lib, .a, .so): 
  - Pick one of:
    - (bsfSource)/Dependencies/(DepName)/lib
	- (bsfSource)/Dependencies/(DepName)/lib/(Platform)
	- (bsfSource)/Dependencies/(DepName)/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
	- (bsfSource)/Dependencies/(DepName)/lib/(Configuration)
- Dynamic libraries (.dll, .dylib)
  - Place in (bsfSource)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)
- Includes
  - Place in (bsfSource)/Dependencies/(DepName)/include
- Tools (executables)
  - Place in (bsfSource)/Dependencies/tools/(DepName)  
  
Legend:
- (bsfSource) - root directory of B3D Framework
- (DepName) - name of the dependency (title of each dependency shown below)
- (Platform) - x86 for 32-bit builds, x64 for 64-bit builds
- (Configuration) - Debug, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel, or Release  
  
Each library is accompanied by a Find***.cmake CMake module that is responsible for finding the library. These modules are located under `Source/CMake/Modules`. They follow the rules described above, but if you are unsure where library outputs should be placed you can look at the source code for those modules to find their search paths.
   
Additionally, if the dependency structure still isn't clear, download one of the pre-compiled dependency packages to see an example.  

## Building dependencies from source

By default, pre-compiled binaries for all dependencies are bundled with the framework, so you do not need to build anything yourself to use B3D.

If you do want to rebuild a dependency from source (for example to tweak compile flags, try a new version, or build on an unsupported platform), each dependency listed below with a `Build script:` entry has a matching shell script under `Framework/Scripts/`. Run it from that directory:

```sh
cd Framework/Scripts
./B3DBuild<DepName>.sh
```

The script clones or updates the upstream source, configures CMake, builds, and installs the result into `Framework/Dependencies/<DepName>/` in the layout the framework expects.

### Overriding the CMake generator

The default generator is picked by `B3DBuildCommon.sh` (`Visual Studio 17 2022` on Windows, `Ninja Multi-Config` on macOS/Linux). To use a different generator, set the `B3D_CMAKE_GENERATOR` environment variable before running the script:

```sh
B3D_CMAKE_GENERATOR="Ninja" ./B3DBuildSnappy.sh
```
