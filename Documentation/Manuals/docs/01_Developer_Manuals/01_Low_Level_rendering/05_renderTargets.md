title: Render targets
---

Before we can actually render an object, we must also specify a render target which will serve as a surface to render the output to. We already covered render target creation in [windows](User_Manuals/Advanced_Rendering/windows) and [offscreen rendering](User_Manuals/Advanced_Rendering/offscreenRendering) manuals. The only difference is that in those manuals we used a **Camera** component to set the target, and relied on the renderer to make use of it.

In this chapter we'll show how to manually bind a render target for rendering, as well as some other render target related operations.

# Binding
Use @b3d::render::GpuCommandBuffer::BeginRenderPass to bind a render target for rendering. This begins a render pass, which must be closed with @b3d::render::GpuCommandBuffer::EndRenderPass.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TShared<RenderTarget> target = ...; // Create a RenderTexture or RenderWindow as described in earlier chapters
TShared<GpuCommandBuffer> commandBuffer = ...; // Obtain a command buffer from a command buffer pool

RenderPassCreateInformation renderPassInfo(target);
commandBuffer->BeginRenderPass(renderPassInfo);

// ... perform rendering operations ...

commandBuffer->EndRenderPass();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will bind the entirety of the render target surface for rendering. If you just want to render to a portion of the target you can also call @b3d::render::GpuCommandBuffer::SetViewport. It accepts a 2D area whose coordinates should be in [0, 1] range and it specifies in which portion of the render target should rendering occur.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Render to the center of the render target, at 50% of its size
commandBuffer->SetViewport(Area2(0.25f, 0.25f, 0.5f, 0.5f));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Advanced binding
**render::GpuCommandBuffer::BeginRenderPass()** accepts a @b3d::RenderPassCreateInformation structure with parameters to control more advanced behaviour:
 - `ReadOnlyMask` - Combination of one or more elements of @b3d::RenderSurfaceMaskBits denoting which surfaces will be bound for read-only operations. This is useful for depth or stencil surfaces which might need to be bound both for depth/stencil tests, as well as shader reads. If you don't specify this the render backend will assume you will be writing to the render target which will result in undefined behaviour if you also try reading from that same texture.
 - `LoadMask` - Mask described by @b3d::RenderSurfaceMaskBits which controls if current contents of any of the render target surfaces should be preserved. By default the system doesn't guarantee the contents will be preserved and data is instead undefined. In certain cases (like blending operations) you want to preserve the contents, in which case specify the necessary flags to tell the system which surfaces need their contents preserved.
 - `Parameters` - Array of @b3d::GpuParameterSet objects that will be bound during this render pass. You must pre-declare all GPU parameter sets you plan to use within the render pass. This allows the render backend to inspect the resources referenced by those parameter sets (textures, buffers) and issue the correct resource transitions and barriers before the render pass begins. Failing to declare a parameter set that is later bound during the render pass can lead to incorrect resource states and undefined behaviour.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Bind a render target with read-only depth/stencil, and preserve the existing contents of depth-stencil buffer on bind
RenderPassCreateInformation renderPassInfo(target, RT_DEPTH_STENCIL, RT_DEPTH_STENCIL);
commandBuffer->BeginRenderPass(renderPassInfo);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Declaring GPU parameter sets

When beginning a render pass you should declare all @b3d::GpuParameterSet objects that will be used during the pass. This is done through the `Parameters` field of @b3d::RenderPassCreateInformation. The render backend uses this information to transition resources (textures, buffers) into the correct layout and insert any necessary pipeline barriers before the render pass starts.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TShared<GpuParameterSet> materialParams = ...;
TShared<GpuParameterSet> lightingParams = ...;

RenderPassCreateInformation renderPassInfo(target);
renderPassInfo.Parameters.Add(materialParams);
renderPassInfo.Parameters.Add(lightingParams);

commandBuffer->BeginRenderPass(renderPassInfo);

// Now safe to bind and use these parameter sets during the render pass
commandBuffer->SetGpuParameterSet(materialParams);
// ... draw calls ...
commandBuffer->SetGpuParameterSet(lightingParams);
// ... more draw calls ...

commandBuffer->EndRenderPass();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also pass a single parameter set using the convenience constructor:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
RenderPassCreateInformation renderPassInfo(target, parameterSet);
commandBuffer->BeginRenderPass(renderPassInfo);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Clearing
Usually a render target will be re-used many times. Unless you are sure that every use will completely overwrite the render target contents, it can be beneficial (and in some cases necessary) to clear the render target to some value. Call @b3d::render::GpuCommandBuffer::ClearRenderTarget to clear the currently bound render target.

The first parameter represents a @b3d::RenderSurfaceMaskBits of which surfaces of the target to clear. The second, third and fourth parameters represent the clear values for the color, depth and stencil surfaces, respectively.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Clear color and depth surfaces. All color surfaces are cleared to blue color, while depth is cleared to the value of 1
commandBuffer->ClearRenderTarget(RT_COLOR_ALL | RT_DEPTH, Color::kBlue, 1.0f, 0);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also call @b3d::render::GpuCommandBuffer::ClearViewport to clear only the viewport portion of the render target. The parameters are identical to **render::GpuCommandBuffer::ClearRenderTarget()**.

Clearing the depth buffer is especially important as the GPU will read its contents during rendering, and having old data in the depth buffer pretty much guarantees your rendering will not be valid.

# Swapping
If a render target is a **RenderWindow** you must present the back buffer after rendering. This is because windows are usually double or triple buffered, meaning the rendering happens to a hidden buffer invisible to the user. When presenting is called this hidden buffer is presented to the user.

You can present a render window by calling @b3d::GpuDevice::PresentRenderWindow or @b3d::GpuQueue::PresentRenderWindow on a specific queue. The GPU device can be accessed through the command buffer via @b3d::render::GpuCommandBuffer::GetGpuDevice.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TShared<RenderWindow> window = ...; // Create a render window
TShared<GpuCommandBuffer> commandBuffer = ...; // Obtain a command buffer

RenderPassCreateInformation renderPassInfo(window);
commandBuffer->BeginRenderPass(renderPassInfo);

// ... draw something ...

commandBuffer->EndRenderPass();
commandBuffer->End();

// Submit the command buffer to the GPU
GpuWorkContext& gpuContext = render::GetRenderer()->GetGpuContext();
gpuContext.SubmitCommandBuffer(commandBuffer);

// Present the window's back buffer
GpuDevice& gpuDevice = commandBuffer->GetGpuDevice();
gpuDevice.PresentRenderWindow(window);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
